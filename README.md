# Security Assessment Lab: Exploiting & Hardening Legacy Systems

## Objective


To design a controlled environment for the execution and remediation of legacy exploits. This lab simulates a corporate network architecture to analyze the lifecycle of an attack—from initial reconnaissance via Kali Linux to the exploitation of Metasploitable 2. The project centers on developing a Remediation Roadmap, focusing on the deployment of compensating security controls at the firewall level and providing host-level hardening recommendations based on validated risk findings.


### Skills Learned


- Network Security: Segmentation via VLANs, pfSense SPI firewall administration, and DMZ architecture design.

- Vulnerability Management: Identifying "Classic" vulnerabilities in legacy systems and implementing Compensating Controls (Virtual Patching).

- Ethical Hacking Lifecycle: Executing a methodical 5-phase assessment (Reconnaissance through Post-Exploitation) using Kali Linux and Metasploit.

- Defensive Hardening: Attack surface reduction through service minimization and enforcing the Principle of Least Privilege.

- Security Documentation: Translating exploit validation into Technical Reports and actionable Executive Summaries.

- Systems Engineering: Hypervisor management and cross-platform troubleshooting (Linux, BSD, Windows).
