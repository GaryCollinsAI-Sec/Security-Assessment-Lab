<h1>Security Assessment Lab</h1>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>
Designed a controlled environment to execute and remediate legacy exploits. Simulated a corporate network to analyze the attack lifecycle—from reconnaissance via Kali Linux to exploitation of Metasploitable 2. Developed a Remediation Roadmap, deploying compensating security controls at the firewall and host-level hardening based on validated risk findings.

<h2>Skills Learned</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Network Security: VLAN segmentation, pfSense SPI firewall administration, DMZ architecture design</li>
  <li>Vulnerability Management: Identify classic legacy vulnerabilities and implement compensating controls (virtual patching)</li>
  <li>Ethical Hacking Lifecycle: Conduct methodical 5-phase assessment using Kali Linux and Metasploit</li>
  <li>Defensive Hardening: Reduce attack surface via service minimization and Principle of Least Privilege enforcement</li>
  <li>Security Documentation: Translate exploit validation into technical reports and executive summaries</li>
  <li>Systems Engineering: Hypervisor management and cross-platform troubleshooting (Linux, BSD, Windows)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tools Used</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Kali Linux (attacker node)</li>
  <li>Metasploitable 2 (vulnerable target)</li>
  <li>pfSense (firewall and network segmentation)</li>
  <li>VirtualBox / VMware (hypervisor environment)</li>
  <li>Metasploit Framework (exploitation and post-exploitation)</li>
  <li>Various Linux/BSD/Windows tools for host-level hardening and testing</li>
